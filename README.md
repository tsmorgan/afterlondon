I tidied them up a little (added some CSS) for easier reading.

I included some javascript to save my progress to a cookie.

I use [Super Simple Highlighter](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/super-simple-highlighter/hhlhjgianpocpoppaiihmlpgcoehlhio?hl=en-GB) Chrome extension to save bits that I've highlighted (you can't see them because it stores them local to me).
